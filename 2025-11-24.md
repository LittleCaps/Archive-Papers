## **The CO-to-H**2 **conversion factor in the Milky Way's central parsec**

What's the difference?

Consistent with the Galactic disck but higher than CMZ (central molecular zone)

## **A search for cold molecular outflows in cosmic noon galaxies**

These weak outflows thus fail to expel a significant amount of molecular gas to CGM scales, as indicated by the absence of molecular emission extending beyond the stellar emission region. This lack of CO emission at large radii could also imply that the molecular gas does not survive at such distances.

## **CO Multi-line Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (COMING). XI. Azimuthally averaged star formation rate and stellar mass relation with molecular gas amount**

This study investigated the relation between the surface density of star formation rate (SFR) (ΣSFR), stellar mass (ΣM∗), and molecular gas mass (ΣMmol) on nearly 1 kpc scales averaged over concentric tilted rings using the 12CO J=1−0 mapping data of 92 nearby galaxies obtained in the CO Multi-line Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (COMING) project.

These results seem to support the inside-out quenching of star formation although the dominant cause of depletion remains uncertain.

## **A deep ALMA Band 3 survey of HDFS/MUSE3D: Survey description and initial results**

## **Multiphase Astrophysics to Unveil the Virgo Environment (MAUVE)**

VLT/MUSE and ALMA

 With its high spatial resolution -- probing down to the physical scales of giant molecular cloud complexes -- and multiphase synergy, MAUVE aims to offer a time-resolved view of environmental quenching and set a new benchmark for cluster galaxy studies.

## **On the baryon budget in the X-ray-emitting circumgalactic medium of Milky Way-mass galaxies**

We find that variations in temperature profiles and uncertainties in the halo mass introduce the dominant sources of uncertainty, resulting in X-ray-emitting baryon mass estimates that vary by nearly a factor of four (0.8−3.5×1011M⊙). Assumptions about metallicity contribute an additional uncertainty of approximately 50%. We emphasize that accurate X-ray spectral constraints on gas temperature and metallicity, along with careful modeling of halo mass uncertainty, are essential for accurately estimating the baryon mass for MW-mass galaxies. Future X-ray microcalorimeter missions will be crucial for determining the hot CGM properties and closing the baryon census at the MW-mass scale.

## **Effect of local environment on Ly**α **line profile in DESI/ODIN LAEs**

The N501 data shows ∼15% higher Lyα line luminosity for galaxies in protoclusters, suggesting increased star formation in these regions. However, the line luminosity is not appreciably greater in protocluster galaxies in the N419 band, suggesting a potential redshift evolution of this effect.

The shape of the line profile itself does not vary with environmental density, suggesting that line shape changes are caused by local effects independent of a galaxy's environment. These data indicate a potential relationship between LAE local environmental density, ionized gas distribution, and Lyα line luminosity.
