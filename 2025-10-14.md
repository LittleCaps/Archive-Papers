## The Spatially resolved Hot Gas Properties of NGC 1266's AGN-Driven Outflow

Combined Chandra, VLA and MUSE data to study the outflow nearby

## BEES: Quasar lifetime measurements from extended rest-optical emission line nebulae at z $\sim$ 6

Extended Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$ and [OIII] 5007. 

Use the light-crossing time of these nebulae to measure quasar lifetimes along transverse sightlines.

Using the H$\alpha$ nebulae, confirm that recombination is likely the dominant emission mechanism behind their previously detected Ly$\alpha$ nebulae.

## Black Holes in the Shadow: The Missing High-Ionization Lines in the Earliest JWST AGNs

At z>5, a marked suppression of high-ionization emission lines (HeII, CIV, NV) relative to prominent broad H$\alpha$ and narrow [OIII] features. 

Need for modified SEDs, either intrinsically softened due to super-Eddingto accretion or radiative inefficiencies in the innermost disk, or externally filtered by intervening optically thick gas that absorbs or scatters the highest-energy photons before they reach the BLR.

## REBELS_IFU: Linking damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption to [CII] emission and dust content in the EoR

With JWST, Ly$\alpha$ damping wings in galaxy spectra can now provide a direct probe of this neutral component.

The resulting HI masses show a tentative correlation with those inferred from [CII].

by z~7 massive galaxies can already host substantial, enriched reservoirs of neutral gas and dust, consistent with $A_V/N_{HI}$ at fixed metallicity, which may point to pristine gas accretion or more efficient dust destruction/expulsion.
