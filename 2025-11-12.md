## **JWST lensed quasar dark matter survey IV: Stringent warm dark matter constraints from the joint reconstruction of extended lensed arcs and quasar flux ratios**

Semi-analytical model, infer DM particle masses by omitting lensed arcs

## **The Deepest GLIMPSE of a Dense Gas Cocoon Enshrouding a Little Red Dot**

20hr NIRSpec/G395M 

These features indicate a dense (n∼108 cm−3), partially ionized cocoon where scattering and fluorescence dominate line formation, providing strong evidence that at least some LRDs are powered by super-Eddington black-hole growth in the early Universe.

## **Finding the boundary: Using galaxy membership to inform galaxy cluster extent through machine learning**

The spatial extent of the environment's impact on galaxies marks a transitional region between cluster and field galaxies.

## **Changing-Look Active Galactic Nuclei in SDSS-V: Host-Galaxy Properties and Black-Hole Scaling Relations**

his result, in turn, implies that CL-AGNs can serve as useful probes of the AGN-host connection, providing access to both AGN-dominated and host-dominated spectra of the same systems.

## **Effect of ionizing photon escape fraction in faint galaxies on modeling reionization history of the universe**

Our results show that the relative contribution of faint dwarf galaxies to reionization depends sensitively on assumptions about the escape fraction for galaxies of different luminosities, and that this is the main source of uncertainty in modeling hydrogen reionization.

## **Warm and cold molecular gas in the cluster center of MACS 1931-26 with JWST and ALMA**

Our analysis suggests that the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the H2-emitting gas is sufficient to lead to the formation of the CO gas. This observation provides new insights into the molecular gas distribution and its potential role in the interplay between the central galaxy and its circumgalactic environment.

## **Effect of molecular hydrogen self-shielding modeling on early Reionization Era galaxies in radiative hydrodynamic cosmological simulations**

These results show that the Sobolev-like approximation alters properties of galaxies and the large-scale universe when compared to the ray-tracing treatment, emphasizing a need for caution when interpreting results from these two techniques in cosmological simulations.

## **From Feedback-Free Star Clusters to Little Red Dots via Compaction**

We address the origin of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) seen by JWST at cosmic morning (z=4−8) as compact stellar systems with over-massive black holes (BHs).

## **Probing the Physical Origin of the Balmer Decrement in the Broad-line Region of Nearby Active Galactic Nuclei via Spectral Variability**

What is Balmer Decrement

To investigate the physical origin of the Balmer decrement in the broad-line region of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we measure the temporal variability of the fluxes of the broad Hβ and Hα emission lines using multi-epoch spectroscopic data of low-redshift AGNs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

## **JWST Lensed Quasar Dark Matter Survey III: Dark Matter Sensitive Flux Ratios and Warm Dark Matter Constraint from the Full Sample**

The relationship between lensed quasar and dark matter

We present the full sample of measurements of the warm dust emission of 31 strongly-lensed, multiply imaged quasars, observed with JWST MIRI multiband imaging, which we use to constrain the particle properties of dark matter. 

## **A warm ultra-luminous infrared galaxy just 600 million years after the Big Bang**

This source is an extreme example of dust-obscured star formation contributing strongly to the cosmic build-up of stellar mass, which can only be revealed through direct and comprehensive observations in the (sub)mm regime.

## **Isolated massive star candidates in NGC 4242 with GULP**

what is GULP

## **Supermassive Dark Stars and their remnants as a possible solution to three recent cosmic dawn puzzles**

In addition, JWST data further strengthen the problem posed by the origin of the supermassive black holes that power the most distant quasars observed.
