## **Positive AGN Feedback Enhances Star Formation in Starburst Dwarf Galaxies**

This enhancement occurs through AGN-driven outflows creating compressed gas regions where efficient cooling preserves the high density while quickly radiating away thermal energy, creating ideal conditions for star formation.

without SN feedback to regulate black hole activity, AGN outflows become too powerful and expel gas rather than compress it.

Our results closely match observations of the starburst dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10, where similar shock-compressed regions of enhanced star formation have been observed. These findings challenge conventional understanding of AGN feedback and suggest that AGN may play a previously unrecognized role in accelerating star formation during active phases of dwarf galaxy evolution.

## **Supernovae Driven Winds Impede Lyman Continuum Escape from Dwarf Galaxies in First 10 Myr**

 We find that LyC escape peaks early, during a period dominated by intense radiation and stellar winds but lacking a fast galactic wind. As the starbursts age, supernovae drive and accelerate the wind, progressively suppressing LyC escape. These results highlight the need for cosmological simulations to incorporate early feedback as a key driver of reionization.

## **Luminosity-Dependent Assembly Bias of Central Galaxies from Weak Lensing and Clustering**

brighter BCGs reside in more concentrated halos yet are less strongly clustered on large scales, yielding a relative bias ratio deviating from the unity at about the 3σlevel. 

## **AGN STORM 2. XI. Spectroscopic reverberation mapping of the hot dust in Mrk 817**

The heating/cooling process we observe indicates that the inner limit of the dusty torus is set by a process other than sublimation, rendering it a luminosity-invariant `dusty wall' of a carbonaceous composition.

## **From nuclear star clusters to Little Red Dots: black hole growth, mergers, and tidal disruptions**

we predict at least a few tens of tidal disruption events and at least a few black hole captures at z=4-6, with a tidal disruption event rate an order of magnitude larger than the black hole capture rate.
