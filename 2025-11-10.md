## **Heavy black hole seed survivors in dwarf galaxies: a case study of Leo I**

what is seed

 The "heavy-seed" pathway eases the problem with the progenitors of these SMBHs having birth masses up to ∼105 M⊙. 

## **Kinematic and extinction analysis of a potential spiral arm beyond the Galactic bar**

More than four arms?

However, studying its innermost regions is challenging due to high extinction and crowding. The detection of a double red clump (RC; core-helium-burning stars) feature at very low Galactic latitudes suggests the presence of a spiral arm beyond the Galactic bar, providing new insights into the Galaxy's structure along this complex line of sight.

How to overcome the extinction

We evaluate this possibility by analysing the proper motion and extinction distributions of the detected RC features. We constructed proper motion and extinction difference maps to investigate the kinematic and reddening properties of the RC populations, and the kinematic differences were validated using N-body simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy.

## **Synthetic JWST galaxy images in the TNG50 simulation - I. Model validation and comparison to observations**

Finally, using a colour-based definition of quiescence, we determine the fraction of quiescent galaxies as a function of stellar mass at 3≤z≤6, which we find to be broadly consistent with observations.

## **LHAASO Detection of Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Emission toward the Giant Molecular Clouds**

The γ-ray from Giant molecular clouds (GMCs) is regarded as the most ideal tool to perform in-situ measurement of cosmic ray (CR) density and spectra in our Galaxy.

## **Discovery of an X-ray Luminous Radio-Loud Quasar at** z=3.4**: A Possible Transitional Super-Eddington Phase**

Such a high αOX suggests the coexistence of a prominent radio jet and X-ray corona, in this high Eddington accretion phase. We propose that ID830 may be in a transitional phase after an accretion burst, evolving from a super-Eddington to a sub-Eddington state, which could naturally describe the high αOX.

What is the limitation

The correlation between Ha line brightness and wind mass flux (using simulation)

## **NGC 6860, Mrk 915, and MCG -01-24-012. II. Inflowing and outflowing cold molecular gas and the connection with ionized gas in Seyfert galaxies**

What is the connection

 The CO in the CND is rotating while outflowing within Rout ~ 3 kpc, with the disturbances possibly being caused by the passage of the ionized gas outflow.

## **The stellar mass function of quiescent and star-forming galaxies and its dependence on morphology in COSMOS-Web**

What's the difference

 The quiescent SMF shows rapid early build-up, with the most massive systems (log(M⋆/M⊙)≳11) assembled by z∼1 and evolving little since.

The star-forming SMF evolves more slowly, following a mass-evolution scenario where galaxies grow via star formation and quench at the characteristic mass log(M∗/M⊙)∼10.6.

Our model supports a scenario where star-forming galaxies grow central bulges before quenching in massive halos.
