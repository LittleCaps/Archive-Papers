## **Ultracool dwarf Science with MachIne LEarning (USMILE). I. Scalable Tree-Based Models for Photometric Spectral Classification and New Discoveries from LSST Data Preview 1 and Euclid Quick Data Release 1**

Machine learning for the classification

## **The SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper Reverberation Mapping Project: Light Echoes of the Coronal Line Region in a Luminous Quasar**

[Ne V]λ3427 is known as one of the "coronal lines," which are a species of emission lines present in AGN spectra with high ionization potentials (≥ 100 eV) that can serve as tracers for AGN activity.

## **The ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST Survey: The Fast Metal Enrichment of Massive Galaxies at z~5**

We present the stellar mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and mass-metallicity-star formation relation ("fundamental metallicity relation"; FMR) of 18 massive (log(M/M⊙) = 9.5-11) main-sequence galaxies at z~5 from the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST sample.

We find little evolution at the massive end of the MZR between z~5 and cosmic noon at z~2, suggesting a fast metal enrichment at early times.

## **Effective cosmic ray diffusion in multiphase galactic environments**

 After being accelerated at supernova remnant shocks, CRs propagate through the interstellar medium (ISM), establishing smooth large-scale distributions and driving galactic outflows. The efficiency of this feedback is controlled by the effective transport speed of the CR population, which in turn depends on the competition between CR-driven plasma instabilities and wave damping processes that vary strongly with ISM phase.

## **CAZ catalog and optical light curves of 7918 blazar-selected AGN**

We use all-sky surveys (CRTS, ATLAS, and ZTF, abbreviated as ``CAZ'') to extract their optical multiband flux density on a nightly basis between 2007 and 2023, and construct as long and as high cadence light curves as possible for as many sources as attainable.

## **Probing down to early cosmic epochs using limited redshift (**z≲1**) optical surveys with host galaxy age and lookback time analysis**

extract lookback time

We conclude that galaxies ultimately evolving into AGN hosts originate earlier (∼8 Gyr ago) than non-AGN host galaxies (∼6 Gyr ago). We relate this fact, that AGN hosts date back to an earlier epoch than non-AGN galaxies, as being likely due to higher cosmic temperatures at that time, probably enhancing black hole accretion. We emphasise that host galaxy age is an additional crucial parameter (apart from cosmological redshift) in defining our understanding of AGN and star formation co-evolution across cosmological time scales.

## **Studying the Dust Distribution Around Accreting Black Holes with Reverberation Mapping Using PRIMA**

RM with the proposed PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) can focus on variability monitoring of a sample of low- to high-luminosity AGNs to trace the 25-30 microns emission that is reverberated from the UV/optical AD emission which will be monitored by other space and ground-based observatories and made available to PRIMA users. Then, by detailed modeling of the response of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths, the distribution of the dust around an AGN will be revealed and can be linked to the accretion disk luminosities.

That's maybe some of Jiangtao's telescope can do

## **MEGADES: MEGARA galaxy disc evolution survey. Ionised gas diagnosis**

We present the ionised gas properties and metallicity gradients of 43 galaxies observed by the MEGADES survey. Using the MEGARA (Multi-Espectrografo en GTC de Alta Resolucion para Astronomia) instrument, our data combine relatively high spectral (R ~ 6000) and spatial (0.62 arcsec) resolution to study the ionised gas through classic BPT diagnostics in the [N II] and [S II] variants.

## **Resolving the dusty star-forming galaxy GN20 at z=4.055 with NOEMA and JWST: A similar distribution of stars, gas and dust despite distinct apparent profiles**

The combined JWST and NOEMA morphology suggests GN20 experienced a recent interaction or merger, likely invigorating the starburst.

The latter highlights the importance of accounting for radiative transfer effects when comparing molecular gas and dust distributions from different tracers.
