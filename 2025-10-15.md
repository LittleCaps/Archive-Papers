## Early massive galaxy formation in the core of a galaxy protocluster 650 million years after the Big Bang 

JWST A2744-Quintet at z=7.9, a core of protocluster. 

The protocluster core is indeed one of the main drivers of efficient galaxy formation and rapid evolution in the early universe.

Understand DM halo environment in AGN is a window into the nature of SMBH.

angular cross-correlation functions between LRGs and AGN is different for Type I AGN and Type II AGN. Type I AGN has more massive halos than Type II AGN

A2744 [CII] 158 $\mu m$ emission 

stellar-to-dust mass ratios and dust-to-gas mass ratios, higher than the very low ratios expected from supernova-driven dust production, but still below the levels attained once efficient grain growth dominants.

A transition phase of dust mass assembly, likely reflecting the oneset of grain growth via metal accretion under accelerated evolution in the proton-cluster core.

This overdensity and the moderate Lyα transmission may be consistent with smaller, Rb∼0.5−1 pMpc bubbles in EGS. 

## **A Possible Shutting-Down Event of Mass Accretion in An Active Galactic Nucleus at z~1.8**

We present the discovery of a large gradual apparent fading event in optical and near-infrared wavelengths in a quasar at z=1.767 by a factor of 20-30 (in optical) over a period of ~20 years in the observed frame.

This network enables the exploration of the impact of previously overlooked mergers of high mass ratio and low stellar masses on galaxy evolution in CANDELS, and can be expanded to surveys from JWST, Rubin, Roman, and Euclid.

## **A census of quiescent galaxies across** 0.5<z<8 **with JWST/MIRI: Mass-dependent number density evolution of quiescent galaxies in the early Universe**

JWST observations reveal numerous quiescent galaxies (QGs) at high redshift (z∼4−8), challenging models of early galaxy formation and quenching.

## **Association of cold gas, massive galaxies, and AGNs in a filamentary protocluster traced by triple narrow-band imaging**

This study clearly shows observationally that accelerated galaxy formation takes place not only in the protocluster core but also in the associated surrounding filamentary structure.

## **Faint galaxies in the Zone of Avoidance revealed by JWST/NIRCam**

The Zone of Avoidance (ZoA) remains one of the last frontiers in constructing a comprehensive three-dimensional map of the Universe. 

These results demonstrate the potential of JWST/NIRCam to probe extragalactic sources through highly obscured Galactic regions, opening new avenues for mapping large-scale structures across the ZoA.

## **Spectroscopic Reverberation Mapping for SARM: The Case of Mrk 1048 and Mrk 618**

Robust extragalactic distance measurements are crucial for resolving the persistent discrepancy in the value of the Hubble constant (H0)). Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), through their compact and variable broad-line regions (BLRs), enable the determination of geometric distances when reverberation mapping (RM) is combined with spectroastrometry(SA).

These results will serve as a basis for absolute geometric distance calibration when combined with VLTI/GRAVITY spectro-astrometric measurements, thereby contributing to the development of AGNs as standardizable cosmological probes.

The discovery of high-redshift galaxies exhibiting a steep spectral UV downturn potentially indicative of two-photon continuum emission marks a turning point in our search for signatures of top-heavy star formation in the early Universe.
