## **A close look at the black hole masses and hot dusty toruses of the first quasars with MIRI-MRS**

Why close

 We use three new broad lines to measure updated BH masses, Hα, Paα and Paβ, finding them to be in the range (4−15)⋅108M⊙. Our black hole mass estimates from all tracers agree with each other and with previous, less accurate, ground-based measurements based on MgII.

 Overall, we confirm that z>7SMBHs in quasars could not have grown from stellar-remnant BHs if the radiative efficiency of accretion is 10%.

## **A dust condensation instability in AGN atmospheres: failed winds and the broad line region**

what is AGN atmosphere; what does the fail mean

vertical structure, an atmospheric structure, 2D hydrodynamic simulations

## **Black holes in the low-mass galaxy regime: imprint of AGN feedback on the circumgalactic medium of central dwarf galaxies**

TNG simulation

## **Significant Evidence of an AGN Contribution in GHZ2 at z = 12.34**

How to define the contribution

Rest-frame UV and optical emission line, using the BEAGLE-AGN tool to fit the spectrum and photometry of CHZ2 

AGN and no AGN model

## **The Multi-Phase Circumgalactic Medium of DESI Emission-Line Galaxies at z~1.5**

Why emission line galaxies different

Star-forming galaxies

## **Living on the edge. A quantitative warning on boundary artifacts in the IllustrisTNG**

Periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) are a practical necessity in cosmological simulations, but they can also introduce numerical artifacts.

## **ALMA and JWST Imaging of** z > 6 **Quasars: No Spatial Position Offset Observed Between Quasars and Their Host Galaxies**

Why no spatial offset is special, what do they trace seperately

ALMA [CII] 158 $\mu m$ dust continuum imaging

JWST NIRCam

 The lack of an offset supports theoretical models that predict that positional offset within these galaxies are either short-lived or intrinsically rare.

## **Only Nitrogen-Enhanced Galaxies Have Detectable UV Nitrogen Emission Lines at High Redshift**

How to enhance nitrogen

Our results suggest that the existing sample of galaxies with measurable nitrogen abundances at z≳5 is incomplete and biased toward galaxies with significantly elevated N/O ratios. Deep (texp∼40−500hours) spectroscopic surveys will be crucial for building a complete sample to study nitrogen enrichment mechanisms in the early universe.
