## **Evolutionary Tracks and Spectral Properties of Quasi-stars and Their Correlation with Little Red Dots**

JWST has revealed a population of red, compact, high-redshift (z∼3−10) objects referred to as ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs). These objects exhibit unusual spectral features reminiscent of stellar spectra with blackbody-like SEDs, large hydrogen Balmer breaks, Balmer line absorption, and classical stellar absorption features such as calcium H&K and the calcium triplet. 

## **Rise of the forsaken relics: connecting present-day stellar streams and phase-mixed galaxies to the Epoch of Reionization**

The `near-far' approach to studying reionization leverages the star formation histories of the Milky Way (MW) or Local Group (LG) galaxies, derived from resolved photometry, to infer the low-mass/faint-end of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) or the ultraviolet luminosity functions (UVLFs) of high-redshift galaxies (z≳6), beyond the current JWST detection limits (MUV≳−15).

## **FLAMINGO: Tracing the co-evolution of hot gas and black holes in galaxy groups and clusters**

Using the large-volume FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations, we examine the role of both central and satellite supermassive black holes (BHs) in shaping this scatter, probing higher halo masses than previously possible.

For haloes with M500 < 10^13 Msun, we find that central BH mass correlates strongly and negatively with gas fraction, such that higher BH masses give rise to lower gas fractions at fixed halo mass, consistent with previous studies. Interestingly, however, for 10^13 Msun < M500 < 10^14.5 Msun the correlation reverses and becomes positive, with overmassive BHs residing in haloes with above-average gas fractions. By tracing progenitor BHs and haloes through cosmic time, we show that this behaviour is driven by the expulsion and subsequent re-accretion of halo gas, regulated by the timing of BH growth and feedback. 

## **Testing the Stellar Feedback-driven Breathing Mode in Low-mass Galaxies with Gas Kinematics**

Hydrodynamic simulations have proposed that stellar feedback and bursty star-formation can produce dark matter cores in low-mass galaxies. A key prediction is that feedback-driven gas outflow and inflow cycles can lead to ``breathing modes'' (rapid fluctuations in the global gravitational potential) which drive correlated variations in galaxy size, kinematics, and star-formation rate.

## **Formation Of Sub-Structure In Luminous Submillimeter galaxies (FOSSILS): Evidence of Multiple Pathways to Trigger Starbursts in Luminous Submillimeter Galaxies**

We present an analysis of rest-frame optical and far-infrared continuum emission in three luminous submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at 3.0≲z≲4.5. The SMGs are spatially resolved down to 400-500 pc (∼0.05'') resolution by James Webb Space telescope (JWST) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations.

These three SMGs exemplify that multiple physical mechanisms exist in triggering starbursts in luminous SMGs at high redshift

## **Time-evolving diagnostic of the ionized absorbers in NGC 4051. I. High-resolution time-averaged spectroscopy**

The spectra reveal three distinct layers of photoionized gas flowing outward from the central black hole: a low-ionization phase (LIP), a higher-ionization phase (HIP), and a high-velocity and high ionization phase (HVIP).

By modeling the two spectra with our time-dependent photoionization code (TEPID), we constrain the density of the HIP gas to lognH=7.7+0.2−0.9 and estimate its distance to be about R=0.45+0.80−0.09 light-days from the black hole, corresponding to R=4000+7000−800 gravitational radii. 

## **The Photometric Analysis of the Environment Around Two Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies at** z∼2

Studying the environments of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) provides insight into whether these luminous systems are reliable signposts of large-scale overdensities. Evidence suggests that individual DSFGs can trace overdense environments, although this association may not be universal.

Based on this study of two DSFGs, our photometric analysis suggests that DSFGs can trace the outskirts of protoclusters or associated large-scale structures. However, our small sample prevents firm conclusions about their ability to pinpoint dense cluster cores. Future multi-object spectroscopic observations are required to confirm the membership and star formation properties of the companion galaxies.

## **The ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST Survey: Stellar and nebular dust attenuation of main-sequence galaxies at z~4-6**

We present an analysis of dust attenuation in 18 spectroscopically confirmed star-forming main-sequence galaxies at z=4.4−5.7 observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFU and NIRCam, selected from the ALPINE and CRISTAL ALMA large programs.

## **Discovery of Repeating Transitions in 25 Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei**

Through selection criteria and visual inspection, we identify 25 RCL AGNs among 331 CL AGNs, corresponding to an occurrence rate of about 8%, indicating that repeated transitions are not rare in CL AGNs. 

## **GLEAM-300: The GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey at 300 MHz**

With this data release we provide mosaic images and a catalogue of compact source components.

## **Linking Electron Density with Elevated Star Formation Activity from** z=0 **to** z=10

The interstellar medium (ISM) in high-redshift galaxies exhibits significantly higher electron densities (ne) than in the local universe. 

1. We derive electron densities from the [S~II]~λλ6716,6731 doublet, measuring values of ne=30-400 cm−3 at z≈0. We find a tight correlation between ne and the star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR), which is well described by a broken power law.

The ne-ΣSFRrelation likely arises because the high ΣSFR, fueled by dense cold gas or elevated efficiency, enhances radiative and mechanical feedback and produces dense ionized gas whose electron densities are further regulated by ambient pressure. We conclude that the redshift evolution of ne primarily reflects the evolution of cold gas density and star formation activity over cosmic time.
