## **Detecting Ca II Absorption Lines with a Fe II assisted Dual Neural Network**

Ca II absorbers, characterized by dusty and metal-rich environments, provide unique insights into the interstellar medium of galaxies.

## **The ASTRID Simulation at z=0: from Massive Black Holes to Large-scale Structure**

ASTRID is one of the largest cosmological hydrodynamic simulations evolved to z=0. ASTRID features a large population of massive black holes (MBHs), covering a wide mass range 4×104∼2×1011 M⊙.

## **The THESAN-ZOOM project: The Hidden Neighbours of OI Absorbers during Reionization**

We use the THESAN-ZOOM radiation hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the connection between properties of neutral oxygen (OI) absorbers and galaxies within the redshift range z=5−8.

## **Probing Helium Reionization Through the** 3He+ **Hyperfine Transition Line**

We investigate the hyperfine transition of 3He+ as a promising probe of the IGM during the final stages of helium reionization.

## **Connecting outflows with radio emission in AGN at Cosmic Noon**

One open question is the driving mechanism of galaxy-scale outflows.

## **Active galactic nucleus outflows accelerate when they escape the bulge**

Large-scale outflows driven by AGNs are an important element of galaxy evolution.

A shallower density profile also improves the fit in the central regions of the remaining three outflows, but they accelerate faster than our models predict; this could be evidence of significant gas cooling and star formation that reduce the total mass of outflowing gas.

## **Mergers lighting the early Universe: enhanced star formation, AGN triggering, and Ly**α **emission in close pairs at** z=3−9

We find a moderate enhancement in specific star formation rate (sSFR) of 1.12±0.05 at separations ≲20 kpc, which is weakly detectable out to ∼50 kpc.

 Finally, we find no significant excess of AGN in pairs, suggesting galaxy interactions are not effectively triggering black hole activity at separations >5 kpc. Similarly, we also do not detect an excess in the fraction of Lyman-α emitters in pairs, implying that at the probed separations, galaxy interactions are not efficient at enhancing Lyman-α photon production and escape, which may only become important at the smallest scales.
