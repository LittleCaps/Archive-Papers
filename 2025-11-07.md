## **Igniting galaxy formation in the post-reionization universe**

How, what's the difference 

we conclude that the presence of cold-dense gas and halo concentration help incite the process of galaxy formation

Concretely, we find that 100% of recently-ignited halos experience cold-dense gas enhancements relative to their matched failed counterparts.
