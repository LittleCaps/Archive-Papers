## **Under Pressure: Decoding the Effect of High Densities on Derived Nebular Properties**

Recent JWST observations have uncovered a population of compact, high-redshift (z>6) galaxies exhibiting extreme nebular conditions and enhanced nitrogen abundances that challenge standard chemical evolution paradigms.

## **Evidence for Dynamical Dark Energy using DESI DR2 Ly**α **Forest**

We present a comprehensive analysis of the cosmological implications of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) Lyman-α forest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, combined with complementary datasets DESI DR2 galaxy BAO, Type Ia supernova (Pantheon+, DES-SN5Y, and Union3), and compressed CMB likelihood.

## **Tracing The Start and End of Cosmic Reionization - Exploring The Role of Ionizing Sources as drivers**

This thesis investigates the Epoch of Cosmic Reionization (EoR), a key period in the early Universe when the first luminous sources formed and their radiation transformed the intergalactic medium (IGM) from neutral to ionized.

## **A great diversity of spectral shapes in the ionising spectra of z ~ 0.6 - 1 galaxies revealed by HST/COS and possible detection of nebular LyC emission**

We present observations of eleven compact star-forming galaxies in the redshift range z = 0.6145 - 1.0053, with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

We conclude that the use of the LyC continuum in the wavelength range close to the LyC limit, which contains both the stellar and nebular continua, requires special consideration to not overestimate the observed f_esc(LyC).

## **Living with Neighbors. V. Better-aligned Spiral+Spiral Galaxy Pairs Show Stronger Star Formation**

Enhanced star formation (SF) with star-forming neighboring galaxies bolsters hydrodynamical contributions during paired interactions. Although the relative spin orientation between interacting galaxies can influence this effect, it has not been comprehensively explored.

 spin-spin alignment (SSA)

We find that SSA is a key factor alongside the conventional parameters of projected separation and the SF of neighboring galaxies.

## **SHELLQs-JWST: Revealing the Spectra of Extended Emission in 12 z > 6 Quasar Host Galaxies using the JWST NIRSpec Fixed Slit**

We conclude from the consistency between our quasar host sample with z ∼ 6 galaxies that the presence of a low-luminosity AGN causes little significant change in the properties of galaxies at z ≈ 6 on 10 Myr timescales.

## **Introducing the Seyfert-LINER Index (SLI): High Resolution (<100pc) Ionization Structures in the ISM of AGN ESO~137-G34**

The LINER cocoon in the SE cone appears more irregular, with inter-cone LINER points likely shaped by both local ISM structure and shocks. Our findings highlight the complex interplay of different AGN feedback mechanisms in the ISM.

## **Probing AGN-ISM Feedback through Extended X-ray Emission in ESO 137-G034**

These results highlight the { importance of both} radiative and mechanical feedback in shaping the circumnuclear environment of ESO 137-G034.

## **Beyond the Local Group - I: Cosmic Filaments Govern the Spatial Alignments of Galaxy Pairs**

This study demonstrates the cosmic web's critical role in dictating pair orientations and motivates future work with kinematic data to unravel galaxy-environment interplay.

## **The MDW Hα Sky Survey: Data Release 1**

The Mittelman-di Cicco-Walker (MDW) Hα Sky Survey is an autonomously-operated all-sky narrow-band (3nm) Hα imaging survey.

## **HI Content of Group Galaxies from the FAST All Sky HI Survey**

These results refine earlier reports of global group HI deficiency: with deeper blind data and uniform treatment of upper limits, we show that HI depletion is primarily confined to satellites and compact cores rather than being ubiquitous across groups.

## **The Velocity Map Asymmetry of Ionized Gas in MaNGA II. Correlation between Velocity Map Morphology, Star Formation, and Metallicity in Regular Disk Galaxies**

The morphology of ionized gas velocity maps provides a direct probe of the internal gas kinematics of galaxies. Using integral field spectroscopy from SDSS-IV MaNGA, we analyze a sample of 528 low-inclination, regular disk galaxies to investigate the correlations between velocity map morphology, star formation rate, and gas-phase metallicity.

## **Spatially Resolved, Multiphase Mass Outflows of the Seyfert 1 Galaxy NGC 3227**

These results indicate that the multi-phase AGN outflows are effective in clearing the inner few hundred parsecs of NGC 3227's gas content on timescales that may set the AGN duty cycle of 105−108 years.

## **QUEST (Quasar Unsupervised Encoder and Synthesis Tool): A machine learning framework to generate quasar spectra**

## **Using Type-II Cepheids as Extragalactic Standard Candles: Distances to M31**

Several standard candles have been tested and used to measure accurate extragalactic distances over the past decades. There have been discussions regarding the possibility of using Type-II Cepheids (T2Cs) as an alternative tool, but rarely was this ever implemented.

## **MIGHTEE-HI: The HI mass-stellar mass relation of massive galaxies and the HI mass function at 0.25<z<0.5**

The relationship between the already formed stellar mass in a galaxy and the gas reservoir of neutral atomic hydrogen, is a key element in our understanding of how gas is turned into stars in galaxy haloes. In this paper, we measure the MHI−M⋆ relation based on a stellar-mass selected sample at 0.25<z<0.5 and the MIGHTEE-HI DR1 spectral data.

## **Galactic bars and active galactic nucleus fuelling in the second half of cosmic history**

We investigate the role of galactic bars in fuelling and triggering Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in disc galaxies up to z∼0.8. We utilise a Deep Learning model, fine-tuned on Galaxy Zoo volunteer classifications, to identify (strongly and weakly) barred and unbarred disc galaxies in Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program i-band images.

We select AGN using three independent diagnostics: mid-infrared colours, X-ray detections, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting.

 Combined with previous results, we suggest that bars contribute to fuelling the population of low-to-moderate luminosity AGN, but major mergers are the principal mechanism for triggering the most powerful and dominant accretion events.

## **The MandelZoom project II: the impact of stellar feedback on black hole accretion through an** α**-disc in dwarf galaxies with a resolved interstellar medium**

We present a suite of high-resolution simulations to study how different stellar feedback channels regulate the growth of central intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters (NSCs).

## **Cosmic Vine: High abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster at z=3.44**

This work reveals a high abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster, demonstrating the accelerated assembly of massive galaxies in massive halos when the Universe was less than 2 billion years old.
