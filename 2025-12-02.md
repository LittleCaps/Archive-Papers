## **CECILIA: The Mass-Metallicity Relation of Low-Mass Galaxies at Cosmic Noon**

We measure a steep MZR slope of γ=0.48±0.11, suggesting a rapid increase in metal retention efficiency with mass, consistent with energy-driven outflows. 

## **Recoiling Black Hole Candidates from Spatially Offset Broad Emission Lines in MaNGA**

The broad line projected velocity offsets range from ~10-600 km/s and suggest motion within the host galaxy potentials. Finally, the implied recoiling MBH surface density upper limit is consistent with predictions that assume random spin orientations in MBH binaries.

## **Green Bean galaxies and the fading echoes of AGN activity**

Green Bean is a rare type of galaxy which represents a short-lived phase in the life cycle of active galactic nuclei (AGN), characterised by large-scale, powerful ionised clouds in the circumgalactic medium.

## **Transition from Outside-in to Inside-Out at** z∼2**: Evidence from Radial Profiles of Specific Star Formation Rate based on JWST/HST**

These findings indicate that galaxies at z>2.5 cannot grow in size via only in-situ star formation, challenging the understanding of galaxy size evolution beyond the cosmic noon. In contrast, at z<2.0, the sSFR profiles transition to exhibit more and more positive gradients at lower redshifts, consistent with an inside-out growth scenario where star formation preferentially expands the galactic outskirts.
