## **Localized Deviations from the CO-PAH Relation in PHANGS-JWST Galaxies: Faint PAH Emission or Elevated CO Emissivity?**

Our results favor a scenario where shear along the bar lanes and shocks at the tips of the bar elevate CO emissivity, leading to the breakdown of the CO-PAH correlation.

## **Mixing between AGN winds and ISM clouds produces luminous X-ray emission**

We investigate the X-ray emission generated by thermal Bremsstrahlung and high-ionisation metal line emission in this mixing phase, finding that it could contribute significantly to the X-ray output of the outflow.

## **Variability-selected AGN in dwarf galaxies: the incidence of AGN in dwarf and massive galaxies is similar**

Dwarf AGN hosts do not show strong differences in their distances to nodes, filaments and massive galaxies compared to the controls, which indicates that AGN triggering, at least in this sample, is not strongly correlated with environment.
