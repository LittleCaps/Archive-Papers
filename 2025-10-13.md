## Ly$\alpha$ Tomography MIACS Survey (LATIS)

7408 optical spectra of candidate z~2-3 galaxies and QSOs

one of the largest optical (rest-frame far-ultraviolet) spectroscopic surveys of faint high-redshift galaxies.

## Galaxy Metallicity Gradients in the Reionization Epoch from the FIRE-2 Simulations

The spatial distribution of metals in galaxies 

Mass-metallicity relation (MZR), more massive galaixes tend to be more metal-rich in both the local universe, and cosmic noon.

a secondary on SFR, leading to the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR)

## HST Confirms Sub-5 kpc Dual Quasar Pairs at Cosmic Noon

z=1.647 and z=3.174

## Identification of molecular line emission using Convolutional Neutral Networks

Pay attention to the power of AI and convolutional Neutral Network in spectra and image reduction.

## Galaxies Underdenties Host the Clearest IGM Ly$\alpha$ Transmission and Indicate Anisotropic Reionization

NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) has been shown to efficiently identify galaxies at z $\sim$ 5.3-7.0 via their [OIII] emission (D. Kashino et al. 2023, 2025; X. Jin et al. 2024; K. Kakiichi et al. 2025)

In this work, JWST/NIRCam WFSS observations toward the fields of J1306 and J359.
