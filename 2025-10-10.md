## A first look at quasar-galaxy clustering at z$\simeq$ 7.3

JWST observations surrounding z = 7.0 quasaar and z=7.5 quasar

## Emergent Denoising of SDSS Galaxy Spectra Through Unsupervised Deep Learning

Denoising methods with Deep Learning

So Deep Learning may be able to increase the quality of the data

## Infficient dust production in a massive, metal-rich galaxy at z=7.13 uncovered by JWST And ALMA

A1689-zD1 has remarkably low dust-to-gas and dust-to-metal mass ratios

The processes that form and destroy dust at later times, or the dust emissivity itself, are drastically different for galaxies in the early Universe.

## GPU-Accelerated X-ray Pulse Profile Modeling

GPU is able to be used in data reduction

## Confirming Near-to Mid-IR Photometrically-Identified Obscured AGNs in the JWST era

By the use of the infrared properties of Haro 11 as a limiting star-forming SED template, the potential contamination of AGN samples by purely star forming SED template can be avoided.

Mid-infrared observations are critical to find complete samples of heavily dust-obscured AGNs (Hickox & Alexander 2018; Lyu & Rieke 2022).

## The cosmic web's Lyman-$\alpha$ glow at z$\approx$2.5; varying hydrodynamic models, dust, and wide-filed, narrow-band imaging detection

## AppleCiDEr II: SpectraNet - A deep learning network for Spectroscopic data

Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Time domain surveys

**SpectraNet**, a deep convolutional neutral network designed to learn robust representations of optical spectra from transients.
