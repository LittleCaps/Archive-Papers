## **The mass-to-flux ratio in molecular clouds. What are we really measuring?**

## **Tracing Nitrogen Enrichment across Cosmic Time with JWST**

suggesting that the moderate nitrogen enhancement may reflect the late stages of a cluster-driven enrichment mode that dominated at earlier cosmic epochs.

## **SAGAN-VI: When Jets Meet Filaments -- Environmental Imprints on the Growth of Giant Radio Galaxies**

We employed a filament catalogue from the SDSS together with the largest GRG catalogue currently available. For each source, we measured the comoving distance to the nearest filament spine, the projected jet spine orientation angle, and quantified lobe asymmetry via the arm length ratio (ALR).

## **The MAGPI Survey: forward modelled gas-phase metallicity gradients in galaxies at** z∼0.3

We measure the seeing-deconvolved gas-phase metallicity gradients of 70 star-forming galaxies at z∼0.3 from the MAGPI survey and investigate their relationship with galaxy properties to understand the mechanisms that influence the distribution of metals and shape the evolution of the galaxies.

Extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) are key tracers of intense star formation and potential analogues of the sources that reionized the early Universe.
