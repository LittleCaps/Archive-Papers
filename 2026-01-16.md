## **Euclid preparation. 3D reconstruction of the cosmic web with simulated Euclid Deep spectroscopic samples**

The ongoing Euclid mission aims to measure spectroscopic redshifts for approximately two million galaxies using the H α line emission detected in near-infrared slitless spectroscopic data from the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs). These measurements will reach a flux limit of 5×10−17ergcm−2s−1 in the redshift range 0.4<z<1.8, opening the door to numerous investigations involving galaxy evolution, extending well beyond the mission's core objectives.
