## **Do Low-Mass, Low-Luminosity AGNs Deviate from the Quasar Main Sequence?**

Our findings indicate that this population may represent a low-accretion analogue within the broader narrow-line AGN family, offering new insights into black hole growth at low mass scales.

## **The quenched fraction of satellites around simulated Milky Way-mass galaxies**

This agreement indicates that the mass dependence of satellite quenching is a robust outcome of contemporary galaxy formation models.

## **Lyman-**α **Visibility During the Epoch of Reionization: Combining JWST FRESCO Grism Data with Keck Archival Spectroscopy**

We define seven groups of [OIII] emitters centered around the brightest LAEs and find that these bright LAEs do not reside in more overdense environments than the average galaxy population.

overdensities alone cannot fully explain Lyman-α visibility.

## **Unified models revisited I: modelling the effect of source geometry on radio galaxy/quasar unification**

The orientation-based unification model proposes that radio-loud quasars and radio galaxies are the same objects observed at different angles.

## **A XRISM/Resolve view of the dynamics in the hot gaseous atmosphere of M87**

## **The influence of external environment at cosmic noon on the subsequent evolution of galaxy stellar mass**

we find that at z≳2, environmental factors become as important as stellar mass in predicting the stellar mass of z∼0 descendants.

## **The GLEAM 4-Jy (G4Jy) Sample: III. Further host-galaxy identification, and redshift assessment**

## **JWST reveals extended stellar disks for ALMA-bright dusty star-forming galaxies in the Spiderweb protocluster**

 In this study, we use the high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation NewHorizon, which self-consistently evolves BH mass and spin, to statistically examine the relationship between AGN jet orientation and host galaxy structure.

## **Diverse stages of star formation in the IRAS 18162-2048 region. Emergence of UV Feedback**

## **Hot, Photoionized X-ray Gas in Two Luminous Type 2 Quasars: Chandra-HST Evidence for a Wind-Driven Sequence**

 Spectral modeling indicates that photoionization dominates the soft X-rays in both quasars.
