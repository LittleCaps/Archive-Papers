## **Living with Neighbors. VI. Unraveling the Dual Impact of Bars on Star Formation in Paired Galaxies Using DESI**

We present a comprehensive investigation into the influence of stellar bars on star formation (SF) in galaxy pairs, using a large sample of low-redshift galaxies (0.02\,<\,z\,<\,0.08) from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR8. Our analysis examines whether bars enhance or suppress SF during pair interactions, and how these outcomes depend on the star-forming properties of companion galaxies. We find that bars either catalyze or inhibit SF in their host galaxies, depending on the companion's SF activity. In particular, barred galaxies paired with actively star-forming companions experience more pronounced central starbursts (with sSFR up to ∼\,2.5 dex higher) than unbarred counterparts, whereas those with passive companions often have suppressed SF (sometimes below isolated galaxy levels).

This work highlights the necessity of accounting for both internal structure and companion properties to fully understand SF regulation in interacting galaxies.

## **Warped Disk Galaxies. II. From the Cosmic Web to the Galactic Warp**

Galactic warps are common in disk galaxies. While often attributed to galaxy--galaxy tides, a non-spherical dark matter (DM) halo has also been proposed as a driver of disk warping.

## **The THESAN project: Lyman-alpha emitters as probes of ionized bubble sizes**

Before the midpoint of reionization, galaxies within larger line-of-sight bubbles (≳10 cMpc) have higher observed Lyαluminosity and equivalent width (EW), demonstrating that the evolving LAE fraction provides a practical statistical tracer for bubble size.

## **Galaxy Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS) X: Molecular gas clumpiness under the influence of AGN**

We find a negative correlation between molecular gas clumpiness and AGN X-ray luminosity (L_X), suggesting that higher AGN activity is associated with smoother gas distributions.

All methods reveal a turnover in this relation around L_X = 10^{42} erg/s, possibly indicating a threshold above which AGN feedback becomes efficient at dispersing dense molecular structures and suppressing future star formation.

## **Modeling the Optical Colors of Galactic Cirrus Clouds in the Stripe 82 Region**

Observations have shown that the optical colors of Galactic cirrus clouds differ significantly from those of extragalactic sources; thus, they can be used to distinguish Galactic cirrus from extragalactic low surface brightness (LSB) features.

## **The slope and scatter of the star forming main sequence at z~5 : reconciling observations with simulations**

Galaxies exhibit a tight correlation between their star-formation rate and stellar mass over a wide redshift range known as the star-forming main sequence (SFMS). With JWST, we can now investigate the SFMS at high redshifts down to masses of ∼106 M⊙, using sensitive star-formation rate tracers such as Hα emission -- which allow us to probe the variability in star formation histories.

## **WALLABY: an untargeted search for H I-bearing ultra-diffuse galaxies uncovers the first known ultra-diffuse galaxy pair**

Using the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) we performed an untargeted search for H I-bearing ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). We identified a core sample of 10 UDGs defined by μg,0≥24 mag arcsec−2 and Re≥1.5 kpc, and a broader sample including 12 additional faint diffuse galaxies (μg,0≥23.7 mag arcsec−2 and Re≥1.3 kpc).

## **Supermassive Black Hole Growth in Massive Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn**

Among the emerging excess of massive, bright galaxies at Cosmic Dawn z≳9 seen by the James Webb Space Telescope, several exhibit spectral features associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN). These AGN candidates suggest that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow rapidly in the early Universe.

In the absence of AGN feedback, we find that the SMBH is starved ∼50% of the time after the onset of star formation in the galaxy. SMBH growth can become self-regulated by AGN feedback if the SMBH becomes massive enough, either by accretion or seeding, for its feedback to dominate the surrounding nuclear region.
