## **The dwarf stellar mass function in different environments and the lack of a generic missing dwarfs problem in ΛCDM**

(1) how does the galaxy stellar mass function, particularly in the dwarf (Mstar < 10^9.5 MSun ) regime, vary with environment, defined as distance from the large-scale structure (LSS) traced by nodes and filaments in the cosmic web? (2) is there a generic 'missing dwarfs' problem in LambdaCDM predictions when all environments - and not just satellites around Milky Way like galaxies - are considered?

 While the stellar mass functions from the three simulations (NewHorizon, TNG50 and FIREbox) considered here do not completely agree across the dwarf regime, there is no evidence of a generic missing dwarfs problem in the context of LambdaCDM, akin to the results of recent work that demonstrates that there is no missing satellites problem around Galactic analogues.

## **Dissecting the mass quenching in TNG50: Galaxy size determines the quenching mode**

 We conclude that kinetic AGN feedback has two key roles in quenching: a short-term, intense effect that quenches the central 2 kpc region, and a long-term effect that suppresses the gas inflow rate and further quenches the entire galaxy.

## **Where Galaxies Go to Die: The Environments of Massive Quiescent Galaxies at** 3<z<5

We observe that MQGs are preferentially found in these massive peaks and within these massive structures: ≈50% of MQGs are found in massive peaks, compared to ≈20% of massive star forming galaxies (MSFGs) and ≈15% of the overall spectroscopically-confirmed population. We also find an apparent dependence on both quiescent galaxy mass and environment, with 75% of the most massive (log(M∗/M⊙≥10.75) residing inside overdense peaks. We compare the star formation histories (SFHs) of the MQGs with the high-redshift galaxy stellar mass function from observations and simulated quiescent galaxies at z>5, finding that the masses from the inferred MQG SFHs regularly exceed either observed or simulated high-redshift galaxies, which suggests indicates that mergers and ex-situ star formation play a key role in the mass assembly of MQGs in overdense environments.

## **Tracing Gas Kinematics and Interactions between H II Regions and Molecular Clouds using VLA Observations of Recombination Lines and Hydroxyl**

Observational studies of HII region-molecular cloud interactions constrain models of feedback and quantify its impact on the surrounding environment.

## **Exploring the Origin of Rejuvenating Gas from MaNGA Nearby Galaxies**

Our analysis demonstrates that using Dn4000 and EW(HδA) provides a reliable way to identify current rejuvenation events in large spectroscopic surveys. The method will enable statistical studies to understand rejuvenation across cosmic time.

## **Filamentary accretion flows in high-mass star-forming clouds**

The scope of this paper is focused on the question if gas is transported to dense clumps inside high-mass star-forming regions through filamentary structures on a scale of several parsecs to the sub-parsec scale. We quantify the gas flows from a scale of up to several parsecs down to the sub-parsec scale along filamentary structures. In this work the accretion flow mechanisms based on gas kinematic data in the three high-mass star-forming regions G75.78, IRAS21078+5211 and NGC7538 are studied with data obtained from the IRAM 30 m telescope. The analysis is carried out using the surface density derived from 1.2 mm continuum emission and velocity differences estimated from HCO+ and H13CO+ molecular line data.

## **Extreme equivalent width-selected low-mass starbursts at** z=4−9**: insights into their role in cosmic reionization**

Our analysis indicates that sSFR and star-formation rate surface density are the primary drivers of their extreme emission line strengths.

## **Identification of Large-Scale (>100 kpc) Radio Jets in Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies**

We conclude that future observations of NLSy1 sources with the next generation of sensitive telescopes may reveal a much larger population harboring large-scale jets, thus providing crucial clues on their origin, propagation, and interaction with the ambient environment.

## **RIOJA. Young Starburst and Ionized Gas Outflows in a** z=7.212 **Galaxy Uncovered by JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec Observations**

 The ALMA-detected galaxies may also have a steeper mass-metallicity relation. These findings suggest that the ALMA-detected galaxies may have experienced more efficient mass assembly processes in their evolutionary pathways.
