## **ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey: Molecular Gas Properties of Line-Emitting Galaxies from a Blind Survey**

CII, CO, CH

The CH/CO column density ratio of ∼10−4 is comparable to that of local AGN-host galaxies, suggesting that CH traces molecular gas associated with AGN activity, possibly irradiated by X-rays.

## **Age and metallicity of low-mass galaxies: from their centres to their stellar halos**

We find no correlation between the metallicity gradients and intrinsic galaxy properties, such as stellar mass or accreted stellar mass, suggesting that these gradients are not a simple byproduct of galaxy evolution in the low-mass regime.

## **Galaxy evolution in the post-merger regime. IV - The long-term effect of mergers on galactic stellar mass growth and distribution**

Our work represents the first direct measurement of merger-induced stellar mass that is independent of stellar population modelling, or fitting light profiles, demonstrating significant and extended mass build-up in late stage post-mergers.
