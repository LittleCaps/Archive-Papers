## **Statistical Properties of Cold Streams In Massive Star-Forming Halos in IllustrisTNG-50**

We find that cold streams are ubiquitous in massive halos at cosmic noon, occurring in more than 80 percent of such systems down to z=1, before becoming rare by z=0. At their peak prevalence (z=2-1), streams are often found in roughly co-planar, three-stream configurations.

Several properties of LRDs

## **LYRA ultra-faints: The emergence of faint dwarf galaxies in the presence of an early Lyman-Werner background**

 Both models produce a minimum stellar mass floor at M∗∼103M⊙, originating from galaxies that undergo a single burst of star formation at high redshift before self-quenching from their first supernovae.

## **The relations between dust properties and galaxy global / integrated quantities in the nearby Universe**

We find that SFR, sSFR or ΣSFR are inconclusive traces of the dust temperature. We also find that the extent of dust emission distribution is slightly lower on average, but comparable with the optical stellar continuum emission one. The results and conclusions can be relevant for larger scales studies of low to mid-redshift galaxies from the latest surveys.

## **Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA): The Properties of Quasar Host Galaxies: Star Formation Histories and Stellar Populations**

 We argue that this indicates that secular processes and minor mergers may be the favored triggers of nuclear activity in the local Universe.

## **Stellar streams around dwarf galaxies in the Local Universe**

Our results highlight the difficulty of detecting streams around dwarf galaxies, and identify the need for improved theoretical modelling of low-mass merger morphologies. Nevertheless, they place observational constraints on hierarchical mass assembly in this regime.

## **Investigating the Impacts of AGN Activities on Dwarf Galaxies with FAST HI Observations**

Meanwhile, AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies have slightly but significant lower Hi mass fraction relatively to the non-AGN control sample in accompanied dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, we find a decreasing SFR in AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies towards denser environments, as well as an extremely low incidence of quenched isolated dwarfs within both AGN and non-AGN subsamples. These results indicate that although these AGN could potentially regulate the gas reservoir of dwarf galaxies, environmental effects are likely the dominant quenching mechanism in the low-mass universe.
