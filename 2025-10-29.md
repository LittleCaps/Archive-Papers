## **Shock Acceleration in the Intracluster Medium: Implications of Micromirror Confinement**

However, in the presence of the large diffusion coefficients one would naively expect in the rarefied, relatively unmagnetized ICM, this acceleration--in particular, the maximum proton energy (Emax)--is limited by long acceleration times. On the other hand, recent work on CR transport suggests that the diffusion coefficient can be suppressed in ICM-like environments.

## **Galaxy Spin Alignment with Tidal Fields in the SDSS-IV MaNGA Survey**

The tidal torque theory (TTT) predicts that galaxy spins are correlated with the surrounding tidal field, reflecting how angular momentum is acquired during structure formation.

We find that massive galaxies tend to align their spins parallel to the intermediate axis of the tidal field, consistent with the prediction of the TTT. They also tend to orient perpendicular to the major axis, hinting at the possible influence of baryonic processes. In contrast, low-mass galaxies exhibit the opposite trend, with a transition mass of M∗∼1010−1010.5M⊙. No significant alignment is detected with respect to the minor axis across all stellar masses. 

## **Molecular Gas in Major Mergers Hosting Dual and Single AGN at <10 kpc Nuclear Separations**

Our results indicate that the probability of occurrence of the dual AGN phenomenon is likely dependent on AGN variability and/or obscuration rather than the availability of molecular gas in the nuclear regions.

## **Spatial-Kinematic Absorption Models of the Circumgalactic Medium. II. Ionized Gas Phases and Absorption Lines**

We briefly describe a SKAM GUI that is in early stages of development.

## **MAGNUS I: A MUSE-DEEP sample of early-type galaxies at intermediate redshift**

 The kinematic and photometric axes of fast rotators are generally well-aligned, similar to their local counterparts. We find that global stellar population properties, such as age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio (M∗/L), correlate strongly with the central velocity dispersion (σe), following trends established for local ETGs.

## **MAGNUS II: Rotational support of massive early-type galaxies decreased over the past 7 billion years**

Understanding how the internal kinematics of massive galaxies evolve is key to constraining the physical processes that drive their assembly.

Our results provide robust evidence that massive ETGs have undergone significant kinematic evolution, losing angular momentum as they evolve towards the present day, consistent with theoretical models where processes such as dry mergers play a crucial role in shaping the dynamical state of galaxies.

## **The luminosity function and clustering of bright quasars in the FLAMINGO cosmological simulations**

 In this work, we leverage the FLAMINGO simulation suite, focusing on its large (2.8 Gpc)3 volume, to investigate two key observables of quasar activity: the quasar luminosity function (QLF) and quasar clustering.

The simulation reproduces the observed clustering across 0≲z≲3, and the reduced luminosity dependence introduced by scatter aligns with observational trends. However, it underpredicts the clustering strength at z≈4, consistent with other models and possibly reflecting high-redshift observational uncertainties.

## **On the Dusty Proximate Damped Lyman-**α **System towards Q2310-3358 at** z=2.40

Surprisingly, given its proximity to the quasar in redshift, the absorber has strong cold gas characteristics, including CI and H2.

## **Spatial-Kinematic Absorption Models of the Circumgalactic Medium. I. Structures, Orientations, and Kinematics**

We motivate and develop four idealized galaxy/CGM spatial-kinematic structures based on empirical data and theoretical predictions: (1) a rotating galactic disk/extra-planar gas, (2) a static or dynamic spherical halo, (3) an outflowing bi-polar galactic wind, and (4) an inward spiraling flared planar accretion.

## **Planetary nebulae as tracers of accreted stellar populations in massive galaxies in groups and clusters**

Planetary nebulae (PNe) are valuable spatial and kinematic tracers of nearby galaxies. In this mini-review, I focus on their role in tracing the halo and intra-cluster/intra-group light assembly in groups and clusters of galaxies within 100~Mpc and, in particular, the link between characteristic PN metrics such as the α-parameter and the PN luminosity function and changes from the underlying in-situ to ex-situ stellar populations.
