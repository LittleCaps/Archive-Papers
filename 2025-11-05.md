## **The origin of ionized gas in retired galaxies: dynamical clues**

We investigate the kinematical and dynamical properties of quiescent cluster galaxies with weak emission lines, referred to as retired (R), and those without emission lines, dubbed passive (P), to better understand the origin of the ionized gas in R galaxies and what drives the differences between these populations.

R, P galaxies and ionized gas

## **Bars in low-density environments rotate faster than bars in dense regions**

why and how

We use estimates of R obtained with the Tremaine-Weinberg method applied to Integral Field Unit spectroscopy from MaNGA and CALIFA. 

## **GMCs and Star Formation in the Galaxy: I. Effects of an HII region on a GMC**

Which effect

HII region destruct GMC

The destruction of Giant Molecular Clouds is a key component in galaxy evolution. We theoretically model the destruction of GMCs by HII regions, which evaporate ionized gas and eject neutral gas during their expansion.

## **An Extremely Luminous Flare Recorded from a Supermassive Black Hole**

What does flare mean

calculate the energy

We report the discovery of an extreme flare by the AGN J224554.84+374326.5, which brightened by more than a factor of 40 in 2018.

We discuss potential mechanisms, including the tidal disruption of a high mass (>30M⊙) star, gravitational lensing of an AGN flare or supernova, or a supermassive (pair instability) supernova in the accretion disk of an AGN. We favor the tidal disruption of a massive star in a prograde orbit in an AGN disk.

## **Solving the cooling flow problem with combined jet-wind AGN feedback**

What is cooling flow problem

long-standing cooling flow problem in galaxy cluster

Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback is widely viewed as the most promising solution to the long-standing cooling flow problem in galaxy clusters, yet previous models prescribe jet properties inconsistent with accretion physics.

## **Searching Within Galaxies for the Earliest Signs of Quenching With Spatially Resolved Star Formation Histories in UVCANDELS**

What are the signs of quenching

reconstruct the star formation history

We measure scaling relations and projected radial profiles of regions within each galaxy at the time of observation and at 1 Gyr lookback time, noting possible trends in the evolution. By comparing the change in star formation over time we can infer the timing and location of star formation and see early signs of star formation shut off before quenching occurs.
