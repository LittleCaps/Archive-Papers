Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR)

## **What is the True HI Gas Content in Massive Quiescent Galaxies in the Local Universe?**

However, the majority (∼2/3) exhibit significantly lower HI content, with a 3σ upper limit of log(MHI/M∗)<−3.46 derived from stacking the non-detections.

 These results suggest that while early-type morphology and environment play crucial roles in suppressing HI reservoirs, neither factor alone fully explains the observed gas depletion, indicating that additional physical mechanisms must be responsible for the extreme HI deficiency prevalent in massive quiescent galaxies.
