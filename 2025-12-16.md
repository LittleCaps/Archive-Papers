Cosmic Duets: dual, lensed AGN

## **NGDEEP: A New Non-Parametric Measure of Local Star-Formation and Attenuation at Cosmic Noon**

We introduce a new non-parametric technique to quantify the spatially-resolved relationship between the local star-formation rate (SFR) and dust attenuation.

## **Kinematics of H I and O VI Absorbers: Insights into the Turbulence Driver of the Multiphase Circumgalactic Medium**

we find that H I absorbers exhibit a clear inverse correlation between Doppler width and column density over nearly five orders of magnitude in NHI, from NHI≈1013 cm−2 to NHI≈1018 cm−2, while O VI absorption follows a positive correlation across NOVI≈3×1013-1015 cm−2.

## **Prospects for Measuring Black Hole Masses using TDEs with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory**

The optical light curves from TDEs can be used to model the physical parameters of the black hole and disrupted star, but the sampling and photometric uncertainty of the real data will couple with model degeneracies to limit our ability to recover these parameters. In this work, we aim to model the impact of the Rubin survey strategy on simulated TDE light curves to quantify the typical errors in the recovered parameters.
