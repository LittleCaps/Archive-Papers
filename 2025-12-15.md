## **An Active Galaxy Cluster Merger at Cosmic Noon Revealed by JWST Weak Lensing and Multiwavelength Probes**

XLSSC 122 z=1.98

## **The abundance of thin dwarf galaxies: a challenge for cosmological hydrodynamical simulations**

We study the prevalence of thin galaxies as a function of stellar mass in the range 107<M⋆/M⊙<1011 using data from the GAMA, DESI, ALFALFA and Nearby Galaxy catalogs.

## **Intermediate Mass Black Hole Binary Evolution in Nuclear Star Clusters: the effect of the stellar mass black hole population**

In this study, we investigate the dynamics of Intermediate-Mass Black Hole (IMBH) binaries within Nuclear Star Clusters (NSCs) that contain a population of stellar-mass black holes (BHs). We examine how these stellar and BH populations influence the dynamics of the IMBH binary and, in turn, how the evolving IMBH binary affects the surrounding stellar and BH populations.

## **MIRACLE III. JWST/MIRI expose the hidden role of the AGN outflow in NGC 1068**

We present new JWST IFS observations of the active galaxy NGC 1068, combining Mid-IR and optical IFS data from MIRI and MUSE to characterize the multi-phase circumnuclear gas properties and its interaction with the AGN outflow and radio jet.

## **Balmer Transition Signatures from Gas-Enshrouded, Dust-Poor Active Galactic Nuclei**

Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently discovered by JWST, show distinctive Balmer-transition features, including prominent Balmer absorption, pronounced Balmer breaks, and large equivalent widths of broad Hα emission, all of which indicate the presence of dense gas surrounding their central black holes.

## **Effects of Varied Cosmic Ray Feedback from AGN on Massive Galaxy Properties**

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide energetic feedback necessary to `turn off' star formation in high-mass galaxies (Mhalo≥ 1012.5 M⊙, 10.4≤log(M∗M⊙)≤11) as observed. Cosmic rays (CRs) have been proposed as a promising channel of AGN feedback, but the nature of CR feedback from AGN remains uncertain.

## **Connection Between Dwarf Galaxies and Globular Clusters: Insights from the Perseus Cluster Using Subaru Imaging and Keck Spectroscopy**

## **Rapid sinking and efficient mergers of supermassive black holes in compact high-redshift galaxies**

## **A Spatially Resolved Evolutionary Sequence of Multi-wavelength AGN Host Galaxies**

AGN incidence is found to increase with stellar mass following a power-law, with the high-mass end dominated by RDAGNs and the low-mass end dominated by NLAGNs.

## **Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS): on the nature of ultra-diffuse galaxies in the Hydra I cluster. V. Integrated stellar population properties**

## **GLIMPSE-D: An Exotic Balmer-Jump Object at z=6.20? Revisiting Photometric Selection and the Cosmic Abundance of Pop III Galaxies**

We present deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy of GLIMPSE-16043, a promising z∼6 Pop III candidate originally identified through NIRCam photometry as having weak [OIII]λλ4959,5007 emission. Our follow-up reveals clear [OIII] emission, ruling out a genuine zero-metallicity nature. 

 The only models approaching the observations to almost within 1σ involve a hot (Teff≃104.7 K) single blackbody embedded in a low-Te nebular environment, suggestive of scenarios such as a tidal-disruption event or a microquasar with strong disk winds.
