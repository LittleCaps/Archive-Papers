## **Disk Formation and the Size-sSFR Relation of Dwarf Galaxies**

Dwarf galaxies are dark matter-dominated systems that are sensitive to feedback and display a diversity of baryonic morphologies. This makes them excellent probes for understanding dark matter and galaxy evolution. 

## **Metallicity Gradients in Modern Cosmological Simulations II: The Role of Bursty Versus Smooth Feedback at High-Redshift**

The distribution of gas-phase metals within galaxies encodes the impact of stellar feedback on galactic evolution. At high-redshift, when galaxies are rapidly assembling, feedback-driven outflows and turbulence can strongly reshape radial metallicity gradients.

These results demonstrate that bursty stellar feedback provides sufficient turbulence to prevent strong negative gradients from forming, while smooth stellar feedback does not generically allow for efficient radial redistribution of metals thereby keeping gradients steep. Finally, we compare with recent observations, finding that the majority -- but, notably, not all -- of the observed gradients may favor a bursty stellar feedback scenario. In all, these results highlight the utility of high-resolution observations of gas-phase metallicity at high-redshift as a key discriminator of these qualitatively different feedback types.

## **Constraining the AGN tori at cosmic noon using high-resolution JWST imaging and simultaneous SED fitting**

We employ a novel SED fitting technique that combines archival low-resolution multi-band photometry at UV to FIR wavelengths with the new high-resolution JWST photometry to constrain essential AGN and torus parameters, such as accretion disc luminosity, torus opening angle, and inclination angle.

We demonstrate that this SED fitting approach leads to better AGN characterisation and tighter constraints on AGN parameters.

## **High**−z **[OI] emission lines: ColdSIM simulations and ALMA observations**

Neutral-oxygen [OI] far-infrared emission lines at 63μm and 145μm are powerful probes of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium, although they have not been fully exploited in high-redshift studies. We investigate the connection between [OI] emission lines and key galaxy properties, such as star formation rate (SFR) and H2 content.

## **Baryonic Masses and Properties of Gaseous Satellite Galaxies**

We present a sample of 127 gas-bearing dwarf galaxies around 56 late-type host galaxies within 30 Mpc using 21-cm HI data from the WALLABY, MHONGOOSE, and ALFALFA surveys.

The inferred quenched fractions and gas-depleted satellites indicate that environmental quenching is effective in Milky Way-mass hosts, likely driven by gas stripping processes.

## **Photometric Redshifts in JWST Deep Fields: A Pixel-Based Alternative with DeepDISC**

Here, we test the performance of Detection, Instance Segmentation and Classification with Deep Learning (DeepDISC) on photometric redshift estimation with NIRCam images from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program.

## **Quantifying Spectroscopic Flux Variations Between JWST NIRISS and NIRSpec: Slit Losses in Emission Line Measurements of z**∼**1-3 Galaxies**

. These results highlight the importance of considering instrumental effects when combining multi-instrument spectroscopic data and demonstrate that source morphology critically influences flux recovery between slit-based and slitless spectroscopic modes in JWST observations.

## **AGN--Host Galaxy Image Decomposition with JWST**

As the capabilities of imaging systems improve with time, confirming that our standard techniques adequately model the increasingly complex structures unveiled is essential. With JWST providing unprecedented image quality, we can test how measurements of galaxy morphology vary with the choice of point-spread function (PSF) and fitting software.

## **Jacobi capture as a pathway to off-center massive black hole binaries in dwarf galaxies**

Their ability to merge outside galactic centers may play a key role in shaping black hole mass assembly. Here, we investigate the dynamics of off-center black holes in dwarf galaxies hosting cored dark matter haloes, where long dynamical friction timescales and core stalling naturally arise. 

## **Accretion-Driven Turbulence in the Circumgalactic Medium**

Such `turbulence-dominated' CGM can be identified in observations via the predicted wide lognormal ionization distributions and large velocity dispersions in UV absorption spectra, particularly in the inner CGM of ∼L⋆ and lower-mass halos.
