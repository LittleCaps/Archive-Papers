## **PROJECT-J: the shocking H2 outflow from HH46**

We analyze the H2 emission observed in the HH46 Class I system as part of PROJECT-J (Protostellar Jets Cradle Tested with JWST), to investigate the origin and excitation of the warm molecular outflow.

## **JADES: Low Surface Brightness Galaxies at 0.4 < z < 0.8 in GOODS-S**

The star formation histories show that the LSBs and HSBs possibly come from the same progenitors at z≳2, though the histories are not well constrained for the LSB samples. The LSBs appear to have minimal dust, with most of our LSB samples showing AV<1 mag. JWST has pushed our understanding of LSBs beyond the local Universe.

## **An Overabundance of Radio-AGN in the SPT2349-56 Protocluster: Preheating the Intra-Cluster Medium**

The overdensity of radio-loud AGN in the compact core region of the cluster may be providing significant heating to the recently discovered nascent intra-cluster medium (ICM) in SPT2349-56.

## **Tracing Quenching in Nearby Galaxies Through Inner Surface Mass Density and Cold Gas Content**

HI and H$_2$ data 

The inner stellar mass surface density within 1 kpc, Sigma1, has emerged as a suitable proxy for bulge growth and galaxy quenching. 

Our results suggest that central bulge growth is more tightly coupled to the depletion of molecular gas rather than atomic gas, with AGN feedback possibly contributing to this process. Our work highlights the utility of Sigma1 and delSigma1 as tracers of quenching in massive galaxies.

## **Milky Way galaxy-analogs and isolated galaxies with bars: environmental density in the Local Volume**

These results show that local environmental density is an effective, physically motivated criterion for selecting Milky Way analogs.
