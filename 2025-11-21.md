## **Trading oxygen for iron II. Oxygen- versus iron-dependent cosmic star formation history**

O-dependent cosmic star formation and Fe-dependent cosmic star formation

## **Fossil group origins XIV: The radial orbits of A267**

Fossil groups (FGs) are groups or clusters of galaxies with a single, massive, central galaxy and with a clear lack of L* galaxies.

We therefore confirm that FGs are characterised by more radial orbits for their member galaxies than the average cluster population. We speculate that this different orbital distribution might be an important element in creating a large dm12.

What is the indirect tracers

UV absorption lines, UV continuum slope, Ly$\alpha$ kinematics, a multivariate model, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, and nebular emission line ratios

## **Too Quiet for Comfort: Local Little Red Dots Lack Variability over Decades**

How? Little red dots just found in recent years?

## **MAMMOTH-Grism: Revisiting the Mass-Metallicity Relation in Protocluster Environments at Cosmic Noon**

What's the relationship

We detect a mass-dependent environmental offset: massive protocluster galaxies are metal-poor compared to field counterparts of similar mass, whereas lower-mass systems exhibit comparable or mildly enhanced metallicities.

WR stars to be the source of He II ionizing radiation

## **Environmental Invariance of the Galaxy Size-Mass Relation**

Different from place to place?

Our results support individual galaxy assembly histories as the primary determinant of galaxy size. The existence of significantly different, environment-insensitive size mass relations for subpopulations separated by color and Sersic index provides a clear target for calibration of the baryon cycle in cosmological simulations.
