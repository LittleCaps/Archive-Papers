What is UMAP

 Instead, we utilized the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm to compress a Rubin-Roman-like ugrizyJH color space into a thin and densely-sampled manifold.

## **Revisiting the X-ray-to-UV relation of Quasars in the era of all-sky surveys**

We revisit this relation using a large, nearly all-sky sample by combining the SDSS DR16Q QSO catalogue with X-ray data from XMM-Newton and the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey DR1, yielding 136,745 QSOs at redshifts 0.5≤z<3.0.
