## **Tracing AGN-Galaxy Co-Evolution with UV Line-Selected Obscured AGN**

Our results indicate that [NeV] and CIV selections target galaxies in a transient phase of their co-evolution, characterised by intense, obscured accretion, and pave the way for future extensions with upcoming large area high-z spectroscopic surveys.

## **Black Hole merger rates in the first billion years in light of JWST data**

We show reasonable agreement with the Bolometric Luminosity function at z=6, where BHs must accrete 10-100 times more gas than in previous works calibrated to pre-JWST data.
